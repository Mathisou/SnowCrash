The perl program is running a webserver on port 4646

We can see backquotes so its executing bash commands : "@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;"

The program is using 2 regex --> it first switch the pass to uppercase then delete everything after the first whitespace : "$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; $xx =~ s/\s.*//;"

It means that we cant simply use the "getflag > /tmp/token" command because it will uppercase everything.

So we create an exploit script shell in a file and we can do a get request as follow : 

- curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/EXPLOIT`'

nice job.
