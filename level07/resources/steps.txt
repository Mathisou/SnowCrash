Execute the binary

Find out that it print "level07", we first thought that it prints the first arg

So we used cutter to reverse engineer the binary

We found out that it exec /bin/echo and the content of "LOGNAME" in env

So we tried to modify his content by /bin/getflag, it printed it.

Then we added && before the command so the final command looks like that : "/bin/echo && /bin/getflag"

bingo.
