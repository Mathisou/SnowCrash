Run the binary

Find out that your uid has to be 4242

Use gdb on it

Disassemble the main using "disas main"

Find out that there is a comparison : "0x0804859a <+14>:	cmp    $0x1092,%eax"

break *main+14 to stop the exec right before it

print $eax --> 2013 (our current uid)

set $eax=4242

and continue the exec (love gdb)

Enjoy your flag :)
