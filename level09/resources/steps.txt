We tried to execute the binary with the token --> seems like the output is encrypted

We tried to reverse engineer it but nothing very interesting for us

We tried to understand the encryption by puting some random letters and we noticed that with "aaaaa..." every characters was incremented by their index.

we built a little python script as follow:

```
import sys

output = ""
for i, letter in enumerate(sys.argv[1]):
    output +=chr(ord(letter) - i)
print(output)
```

Some of the characters of the token were non printable so we gave to the script the output of `cat token` to decrypt the flag without copy/paste the non printable chars. --> python /tmp/script.py `cat token`

quadruple booooom
