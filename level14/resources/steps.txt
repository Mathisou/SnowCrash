There is no files in the home

We checked if there is any file owned by flag14 with find / -user flag14 2>/dev/null but nothing

The only thing that seems to be interesting is the getflag binary. Lets be curious and run gdb on it.

At first launch we have an error "Do not reverse this" so lets disas the main to bypass this error

we can see those lines :

```
0x08048989 <+67>:	call   0x8048540 <ptrace@plt>
0x0804898e <+72>:	test   %eax,%eax
```

It checks if the return of ptrace is zero or not -->lets put a breakpoint here and print the value

```
print $eax --> -1
```

Lets modify it to bypass the check

```
set $eax=0
c (continue)
```

Nice, we bypassed it but now we have this message :

```
Check flag.Here is your token : 
Nope there is no token here for you sorry. Try again :)
[Inferior 1 (process 3660) exited normally]"
```

Lets put another breakpoint at the next cmp : "0x08048b15 <+463>:	cmp    $0xbbe,%eax"

It compares eax which is our uid (2014) with 0xbbe which is void

Now what should we do to have access to our flag?

Lets check the uid in /etc/passwd --> triple double boomm, we see that the uid of flag14 is 3014 lets try that

now modify eax with 3014
set $eax=3014
c (continue)

```
===>    (gdb) set $eax=3014
	(gdb) c
	Continuing.
	Check flag.Here is your token : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
	[Inferior 1 (process 3661) exited normally]
```

Now you can finish the project by redeeming it

```
su flag14
Password: 
Congratulation. Type getflag to get the key and send it to me the owner of this livecd :)
```
