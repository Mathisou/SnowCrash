lets find something by using find

find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null

-->/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

as you can see, this file execute and delete every files in /opt/openarenaserver

at first we tried create scripts in the /opt/openarenaserver and we noticed that our files keep be deleted. So we wondered why, and we checked cron and double boom!! the script is executed every 2 minutes.

You just have to create a shell script that execute /bin/getflag and that redirect the output in new file in /tmp/.

enjoy your flag
